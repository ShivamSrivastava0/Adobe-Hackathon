# üöÄ Adobe India Hackathon 2025: Challenge 1B ‚Äî Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Problem Statement
Build an advanced, scalable solution to analyze multiple PDF collections and extract the most relevant content for specific personas and use cases. The system must:
- Process diverse document collections (3-5 PDFs per collection)
- Extract and rank sections/subsections by relevance to a persona‚Äôs job-to-be-done
- Support multilingual documents
- Run CPU-only, offline, and process each collection in under 60 seconds

---

## Why This Matters
In today‚Äôs information-rich world, professionals are overwhelmed by lengthy documents. Our solution empowers users to instantly surface the most actionable, persona-specific insights from massive PDF collections‚Äîunlocking productivity, compliance, and smarter decision-making.

---

## üí° Solution Overview
Our system is an intelligent, persona-driven document analyst that:
- Extracts, semantically ranks, and summarizes the most relevant sections from each PDF
- Handles multiple collections, each with its own persona and task
- Outputs structured, explainable JSON for downstream automation or review

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Models Used
- *Python 3.10* ‚Äî Fast, robust scripting
- *pdfminer.six* ‚Äî Reliable PDF parsing and text extraction
- *scikit-learn (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)* ‚Äî Lightweight, interpretable semantic ranking
- *langdetect* ‚Äî Multilingual support for global document sets
- *Docker* ‚Äî Reproducible, portable, and secure execution

---

## üß† Methodology
1. *Section Extraction:*
   - Custom heuristics (font size, boldness, alignment) to robustly extract headings/sections from any PDF layout
2. *Multilingual Detection:*
   - Each section‚Äôs language is detected and recorded for transparency and global applicability
3. *Semantic Ranking:*
   - Persona and job-to-be-done are combined into a query
   - Each section is ranked by semantic similarity (TF-IDF + cosine) to the persona‚Äôs needs
4. *Subsection Analysis:*
   - Granular extraction and ranking of subsections for deeper insights
5. *Output:*
   - Clean, standardized JSON with metadata, ranked sections, and language tags

---

## ‚ö° What Sets Us Apart
- *Truly Multilingual:* Handles any language, making it enterprise-ready
- *Explainable AI:* No black-box models‚Äîjudges can trace every ranking
- *Speed & Efficiency:* Processes 3-5 PDFs per collection in <60s on CPU
- *Generalizable:* Works for HR, travel, legal, research, and more
- *Hackathon-Ready:* Fully containerized, reproducible, and easy to test

---

## üèÜ Challenges & How We Solved Them
- *Diverse PDF Layouts:*
  - Built robust heuristics to handle inconsistent headings and structures
- *Multilingual Content:*
  - Integrated language detection and ensured ranking works across languages
- *Speed Constraints:*
  - Optimized parsing and ranking for sub-minute performance on CPU
- *No Internet/No GPU:*
  - All models and dependencies are lightweight and offline
- *Explainability:*
  - Chose interpretable models (TF-IDF) so every decision is auditable

## üöÄ How to Run (in 60 seconds!)
1. *Build the Docker image:*
   powershell
   docker build -t challenge1b .
   
2. *Prepare your input collections:*
   - Place PDFs and challenge1b_input.json in each Collection_* folder
3. *Run the container:*
   powershell
   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/app/input" -v "$PWD/output:/app/output" challenge1b
   
   - Output will be in /app/output as JSON files

---

## üìë Input/Output Format
- See sample challenge1b_input.json and output JSONs in each collection folder
- Output includes metadata, ranked sections, subsections, and language tags

## üìù Requirements & Constraints
- Python 3.10
- CPU-only, no internet
- Model size ‚â§1GB
- Processing time ‚â§60s for 3-5 documents
